The angular/cli versions and their installed angular/compiler versions:

1.0 - 1.4.x = ^4.0.0
1.5.x = ^5.0.0
1.6.x - 1.7.x = ^5.2.0
6.x = ^6.0.0
7.x = ^7.0.0
Can be confirmed by reviewing the angular/cli's package.json file in the repository. One would have to install the specific cli version to get the specific angular version:

npm -g install @angular/cli@1.5.* # For ^5.0.0
